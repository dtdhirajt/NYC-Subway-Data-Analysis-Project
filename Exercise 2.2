# Now, create a function that calculates the number of rainy days. For this, return the count of the number of days where the column "rain" is equal to 1.
# Tip: You might think that interpreting numbers as integers or floats might not work at first. To handle this issue, it might be useful to convert these numbers into integers. You can do this by writting cast (column as integer). So, for example, if we want to launch the column maxtempi as an integer, we have to write something like cast (maxtempi as integer) = 76, instead of just where maxtempi = 76.

def num_rainy_days(df) :
    count = len(df[df['rain']==1])
    return count


df["rain"] = df.rain.astype(int)
rainy_days = num_rainy_days(df)
rainy_days
