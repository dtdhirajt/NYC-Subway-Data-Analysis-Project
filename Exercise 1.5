# Do the same thing you did in the previous exercise, but taking into account the exits, column EXITSn. For this, you need to create a column called EXITSn_hourly and insert the difference between the column EXITSn in the current line vs he previous line. If there is any NaN, fill it out/replace by 0.

import pandas

def get_hourly_exits(df):
    df["EXITSn_hourly"] = df.EXITSn - df.EXITSn.shift(1)
    df = df.fillna(1)
    return df

df = get_hourly_exits(df)
