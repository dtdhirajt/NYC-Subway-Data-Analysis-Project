# The data you just plotted is in what kind of distribution? Is there a difference in distribution between rainy and non-rainy days?

** Answer **: It is binomial distribution. Binomial distribution is type of Bernoulli distribution. (Having output 0 or 1). Yes there is difference in distribution between rainy and non rainy days. rainy days occure more than 40000 times and non rainy days occures more than 80000. so non rainy days have two times more distribution than rainy days.
