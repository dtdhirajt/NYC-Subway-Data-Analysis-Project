# Write down a function that takes the list of all names of the files you downloaded in Exercise 1.1 and compile them into one single file. There must be only one header line in the output file.
# For example, if file_1 has: line 1... line 2...
# and the other file, file_2, has: line 3... line 4... line 5...
#We must combine file_1 and file_2 into one master file, as follows:
# 'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn' line 1... line 2... line 3... line 4... line 5...
