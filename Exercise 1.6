Given an entry variable that represents time, in the format: "00:00:00" (hour: minutes: seconds)
Write a function to extract the hour part from the time in the entry variable And return it as an integer. For example:
     1) if hour is 00, your code must return 0
     2) if hour is 01, your code must return 1
     3) if hour is 21, your code must return 21

from datetime import datetime

def time_to_hour(time):
        hour_object = datetime.strptime(time,'%H:%M:%S')
        hour = hour_object.hour
        return int(hour)


for index, row in df.iterrows():
    hour = time_to_hour(row["TIMEn"])
    df.loc[index,'HOUR'] = hour
df.head()
