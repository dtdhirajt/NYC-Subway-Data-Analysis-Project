# The entry for this exercise is the same file from the previous session (Exercise 2). You can download the file from this link:
# https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud359/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv
# Now, we will create a mapper. For each entry line, the mapper exit must PRINT (not return) UNIT as a key, and the number of ENTRIESn_hourly as the value. Separate the key and the value with a tab. For example: 'R002 \ t105105.0'
# Export your mapper into a file named mapper_result.txt and send it with your submission. The code for exporting your mapper is already written in the code bellow.

import sys
import csv

def mapper():
    
    
    for line in sys.stdin:
        data = line.strip().split(',')
        if len(data) == 22 :
            if data [1] == 'UNIT' and data[6] == 'ENTRIESn_hourly' :
                continue
            else :
                print(data[1], "\t", data[6])


mapper()
sys.stdin = open('turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv')
sys.stdout = open('mapper_result.txt', 'w')
